Arrow functions have _lexical `this`_ value. This means, they inherit `this` value from the context they are _defined_. And later it stays _unchangeable_, even if explicitly _bound_ or called in a different context.

In this case both arrow functions are created within the context of `{x: 'outer'}`, and `.bind({ x: 'inner' })` applied on the first function doesn't make difference.

So the answer is: `['outer', 'outer']`.
