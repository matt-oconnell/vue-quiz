This is an obfuscated syntax playing, but let's try to figure it out :)

First of all, since ES5 era, _keywords_ are allowed as _property names_. So on a simple object example, it can look like:

```javascript
let foo = {
  class: function() {}
};
```

And ES6 standardized _concise method definitions_, that allows dropping the `: function` part, so we get the:

```javascript
let foo = {
  class() {}
};
```

This is exactly what corresponds to the inner `class () {}` -- it's a _method_ inside a class.

The class itself is _anonymous_, so we can rewrite the example:

```javascript
let c = class {
  class() {}
};

new c();
```

Now, instead of assigning to the varialbe `c`, we can instantiate it directly:

```javascript
new class {
  class() {}
};
```

The result of a default class is always a simple object. And its `typeof` should return `"object"`:

```javascript
typeof (new class {
  class() {}
});
```

And the answer is: `"object"`.
