This [IIFE](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/) is executed with no explicit `this` value. In ES6 it means it will be `undefined` (the same as in [strict mode](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/#codethiscode-value-restrictions) in ES5).

So the variable `f` is bound to the `class h {}`. Its `typeof` is a `"function"`, since classes in ES6 is a _syntactic sugar_ on top of the constructor _functions_.

However, the `class h {}` itself is created in the _expression position_, that means its name `h` _is not added_ to the environment. And testing the `typeof h` should return `"undefined"`.

And the answer is: `["function", "undefined"]`.
