The most complex question for me in this quiz. I didn't get it right initially until read the [spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-functiondeclarationinstantiation) and [clarified](https://twitter.com/DmitrySoshnikov/status/662035788826337281) with [@kangax](https://twitter.com/kangax). First I answered `[2, undefined, 1]`, which is _"almost correct"_, except _one subtle thing_. The correct answer here is the first one, `[2, 1, 1]`, and let's see why.

[As we know](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es6-notes-default-values-of-parameters/#conditional-intermediate-scope-for-parameters), parameters create _extra scope_ in case of using [default values](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es6-notes-default-values-of-parameters/).

Parameter `f` is always the function (the default value, since it's not passed), and it _captures_ `x` exactly from the _parameters scope_, that is `1`.

Local _variable_ `x` _shadows_ the parameter with the same name, `var x;`. It's [hoisted](http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/notes/note-4-two-words-about-hoisting/), and is assigned default value... `undefined`? Yes, _usually_ it would be assigned value `undefined`, but not in this case, and this is the subtle thing we mentioned. If there is a parameter with the same name, then the local binding is initialized not with `undefined`, but with the value (including default) of that parameter, that is `1`.

So the variable `y` gets the value `1` as well, `var y = x;`.

Next assignment to local variable `x` happens, `x = 2`, and it gets value `2`.

By the time of the return, we have `x` is `2`, `y` is `1`, and `f()` is also `1`. It's also a tricky part: since `f` was created in the scope of parameters, its `x` refers to the _parameter_ `x`, which is still `1`.

And the final return value is: `[2, 1, 1]`.
