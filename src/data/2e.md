Variable `y` will eventually have value `1` since:

First, `let x` defines `x` with the value `undefined`.

Then, _destructuring assignment_ `{ x: y = 1 } = { x }` on the _right hand side_ has a _short notation_ for an object literal: the `{x}` is equivalent to `{x: x}`, that is an object `{x: undefined}`.

Once it's destructured the pattern `{ x: y = 1 }`, we extract variable `y`, that corresponds to the property `x`. However, since property `x` is `undefined`, the _default value_ `1` is assigned to it.

So the answer is: `1`.
